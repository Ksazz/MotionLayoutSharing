    <string name="collapsing_text">Jetpack is a collection of Android software components to make it easier for you to
        develop great Android apps. These components help you follow best practices, free you from writing boilerplate
        code, and simplify complex tasks, so you can focus on the code you care about.
        Jetpack comprises the androidx.* package libraries, unbundled from the platform APIs. This means that it offers
        backward compatibility and is updated more frequently than the Android platform, making sure you always have
        access to the latest and greatest versions of the Jetpack components.
